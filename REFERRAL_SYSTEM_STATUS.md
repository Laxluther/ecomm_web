# Referral System Status Report

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Referral Codes Now Showing in Profile

### **Problem Identified**
Users were not seeing their referral codes in their profile because:
1. The `ReferralModel.generate_code()` function only created entries in `referral_codes` table
2. It wasn't updating the `users.referral_code` column that the profile page displays
3. Existing users didn't have referral codes generated

### **Solution Applied**

#### **1. Fixed Code Generation**
Updated `ReferralModel.generate_code()` to update both tables:

```python
@staticmethod
def generate_code(user_id):
    base_code = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=6))
    code = f"REF{base_code}"
    
    # Insert into referral_codes table (for tracking)
    execute_query("""
        INSERT INTO referral_codes (user_id, code, status, created_at)
        VALUES (%s, %s, 'active', %s)
    """, (user_id, code, ReferralModel.current_time()))
    
    # Update user's referral_code column (for profile display)
    execute_query("""
        UPDATE users SET referral_code = %s, updated_at = %s
        WHERE user_id = %s
    """, (code, ReferralModel.current_time(), user_id))
    
    return code
```

#### **2. Fixed Existing Users**
Generated referral codes for existing users who didn't have them:
- `sanidhya (sanidhyarana02@gmail.com)`: `REFQ80WCU`
- `Test (test@gmail.com)`: `REFOB3GPT`

## 📊 **Database Structure**

### **Tables Used**
1. **`users`** - Stores user's own referral code and who referred them
2. **`referral_codes`** - Tracks all generated codes with status
3. **`referral_uses`** - Links referrer to referee with reward status
4. **`wallet`** - Stores user wallet balances
5. **`wallet_transactions`** - Records all referral reward transactions

### **Key Relationships**
```sql
users.referral_code          # User's own code to share
users.referred_by           # Who referred this user
referral_codes.user_id      # Owner of the referral code
referral_uses.referrer_user_id    # Person who gets the reward
referral_uses.referee_user_id     # Person who used the code
```

## 🎯 **Frontend Integration**

### **Profile Page** (`/profile`)
```typescript
// Fetches user's referral data
const { data: referralData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["referrals"],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await api.get("/user/referrals")
    return response.data
  },
})

// Displays referral code with copy functionality
<code className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm">
  {referralData?.referral_code || "Loading..."}
</code>
```

### **Registration Page** (`/register`)
- Input field for referral code during signup
- Real-time validation of entered codes
- Success/error messages for code validity
